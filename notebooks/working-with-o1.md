    SOLUTION PLAN FOR DATA ANALYSIS CHALLENGE
    
    Key Challenges:
    - Large, unstructured dataset with potential inconsistencies
    - Need to identify subtle patterns across multiple variables
    - Time-sensitive analysis requiring both accuracy and reasonable speed
    
    Step 1: Data Cleaning and Preparation
    - Best Model: GPT (faster processing for well-defined task)
    - Actions: Normalize data formats, handle missing values, identify outliers
    - Success Criteria: Clean dataset with consistent formatting and documented handling of anomalies
    
    Step 2: In-depth Pattern Analysis
    - Best Model: Reasoning (complex relationship identification)
    - Actions: Identify correlations between variables, detect unusual patterns, generate hypotheses
    - Success Criteria: Comprehensive list of statistically significant patterns with confidence levels
    
    Step 3: Predictive Model Development
    - Best Model: GPT (code generation for standard ML algorithms)
    - Actions: Implement predictive models based on patterns identified in Step 2
    - Success Criteria: Working code for at least 2 different predictive models with evaluation metrics
    
    Step 4: Result Interpretation and Recommendations
    - Best Model: Reasoning (complex decision making with multiple factors)
    - Actions: Interpret results, assess business implications, develop actionable recommendations
    - Success Criteria: Clear, prioritized set of recommendations with expected business impacts
