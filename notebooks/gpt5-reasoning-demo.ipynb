      "- Setter injection: Provide optional or replaceable dependencies via setters.\n",
      "- Method parameter injection: Pass dependencies directly to specific methods.\n",
      "- Field injection: Framework sets fields directly; convenient but harder to test and hides required dependencies.\n",
      "- Interface injection (rare): The dependency is injected via an interface method the class implements.\n",

      "DI vs IoC containers\n",
      "\n",
      "- DI is the pattern of supplying dependencies from the outside.\n",
      "- An IoC/DI container is a tool that automates wiring: it knows how to build objects, resolve their dependencies, manage lifetimes, and often configuration.\n",
      "- You can do DI manually (newing things up in a composition root), or use a container. Containers help at scale but add indirection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scopes and lifecycles (with containers)\n",
      "\n",
      "- Singleton: One instance for the app (e.g., configuration, logger).\n",
      "- Scoped: One per logical scope (e.g., per web request).\n",
      "- Transient: New instance each time it’s requested.\n",
      "- Containers can also do lazy instantiation, interception (e.g., logging, metrics), and automatic disposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "When DI might be overkill or misused\n",
      "\n",
      "- Very small scripts or simple, stable modules: passing one or two parameters manually is fine.\n",
      "- Over-abstracting: Creating interfaces for everything can introduce unnecessary complexity.\n",
      "- Service locator anti-pattern: Hiding dependencies behind a global lookup (ServiceLocator.get()) makes code harder to test and reason about. Prefer explicit injection.\n",
      "- Excessive magic: Heavy use of reflection/annotations can hinder debuggability; prefer explicit wiring where possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ecosystem examples\n",
      "\n",
      "- Java: Spring, Guice, Dagger, Micronaut. Spring uses annotations and a container to wire beans, manage scopes, and lifecycle.\n",
      "- .NET: Built-in DI container (IServiceCollection, IServiceProvider) with scoped/singleton/transient lifetimes.\n",
      "- JavaScript/TypeScript: Angular and NestJS have built-in DI; in Node, lightweight options or manual composition are common.\n",
      "- Python: FastAPI’s Depends (request-scoped injections), dependency-injector library, or manual wiring.\n",
      "- Other: Many frameworks provide DI to manage controllers, services, repositories, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Practical tips\n",
      "\n",
      "- Prefer constructor injection for required dependencies; keep constructors small.\n",
      "- Define interfaces only where you truly need substitutability (e.g., external systems).\n",
      "- Create a composition root (application startup) that wires the graph in one place.\n",
      "- Keep object graphs shallow when possible; refactor if a class needs many dependencies (it might be doing too much).\n",
      "- In tests, inject fakes/mocks directly; with containers, you can override registrations in test modules.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short: Dependency injection makes code easier to test, change, and reason about by externalizing how dependencies are provided and managed, often with help from a container to automate wiring and lifecycle at scale.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Reasoning models think before answering** - hidden reasoning tokens enable better problem-solving\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Start with medium effort** - it's the best balance for most tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use minimal for speed** - when you need fast responses for simple tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use high for accuracy** - when correctness is critical and you can afford the latency\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Keep prompts clear and direct** - don't ask the model to \"think step-by-step\"\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Control output length with verbosity** - separate from reasoning depth\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Use the Responses API** - it's designed specifically for reasoning models"
