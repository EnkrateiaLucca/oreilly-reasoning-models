    "__GPT Models (4o, 4.1)__: Optimized for general-purpose tasks with excellent instruction following. GPT-4.1 excels with long contexts (1M tokens) while GPT-4o has variants for realtime speech, text-to-speech, and speech-to-text. GPT-4.1 also comes in a mini, and nano variant, while GPT-4o has a mini variant. These variants are cheaper and faster than their full-size counterparts.\n",

    "__o-series Models (o3, o4-mini)__: Specialized for deep reasoning and step-by-step problem solving. These models excel at complex, multi-stage tasks requiring logical thinking and tool use. Choose these when accuracy and reasoning depth are paramount. These models also have an optional reasoning_effort parameter (that can be set to low, medium, or high), which allows users to control the amount of tokens used for reasoning."
