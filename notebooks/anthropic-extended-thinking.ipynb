    "This notebook demonstrates Claude's extended thinking capabilities - a powerful feature that gives Claude enhanced reasoning for complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Extended Thinking?\n",
    "\n",
    "Extended thinking allows Claude to \"think\" through complex problems step-by-step before providing a final answer. This is particularly useful for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mathematical problems** requiring multi-step calculations\n",
    "- **Complex analysis** of documents or data\n",
    "- **Architecture decisions** in software development\n",
    "- **Strategic planning** and decision-making\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "When extended thinking is enabled, Claude:\n",
    "1. Creates internal \"thinking\" content blocks\n",
    "2. Works through the problem systematically\n",
    "3. Incorporates insights from this reasoning\n",
    "4. Delivers a more thoughtful final response"

    "## 11. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We've Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extended Thinking Basics**: How to enable and use Claude's reasoning capabilities\n",
    "2. **Model Support**: All Claude 4+ models support extended thinking\n",
    "3. **Budget Tokens**: Start minimal (1,024) and increase based on task complexity\n",
    "4. **Streaming**: Required for large max_tokens, improves UX\n",
    "5. **Tool Use**: Only `tool_choice: \"auto\"` or `\"none\"` supported\n",
    "6. **Interleaved Thinking**: Beta feature for reasoning between tool calls (Claude 4 only)\n",
    "7. **Summarized Thinking**: Claude 4+ returns summaries, billed for full tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Extended Thinking for:**\n",
    "- Complex multi-step problems requiring sequential reasoning\n",
    "- Deep document analysis and structured evaluation\n",
    "- Strategic planning with multiple constraints\n",
    "- STEM problems and optimization tasks\n",
    "- Quality-critical tasks where accuracy matters more than speed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Avoid Extended Thinking for:**\n",
    "- Simple queries or lookups\n",
    "- Real-time chat applications\n",
    "- Tasks where latency is critical\n",
    "- High-volume, low-complexity requests\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't toggle thinking mid-conversation (complete the assistant turn first)\n",
    "- Don't use with forced tool use or modified temperature settings\n",
    "- Don't manually edit or parse signature fields\n",
    "- Don't over-specify instructions (let Claude's creativity work)\n",
    "- Don't forget to pass thinking blocks back unchanged when using tools\n",
