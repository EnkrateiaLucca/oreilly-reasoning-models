# Reasoning LLMs Report

Reasoning LLMs: A Beginner’s Mini-Course

Welcome to this mini-course on reasoning large language models (LLMs). Here we’ll explore what reasoning LLMs are, how they differ from standard models, survey the major reasoning-focused models available today, and learn how to use and evaluate them effectively. We’ll include hands-on code examples (in Python) and practical tips. By the end, you should have a solid mental framework for working with reasoning LLMs in real-world applications.

1. What Are Reasoning LLMs (and How Are They Different)?

Reasoning LLMs are language models specially designed to solve complex, multi-step problems by generating intermediate reasoning steps or “thought processes” ￼. Instead of jumping straight to a final answer, these models break down tasks into sub-steps, much like a person working through a problem step by step. This approach often leads to more accurate and explainable results on challenging tasks (math problems, logic puzzles, code debugging, etc.) compared to traditional LLMs that output only a final answer.

Traditional LLMs vs. Reasoning LLMs: A regular model like GPT-3.5 or vanilla LLaMA tries to directly predict the answer based on patterns in its training data. It might produce a fluent response, but it doesn’t explicitly show its work or verify the answer. These models often mimic training examples and can stumble on problems requiring planning or multi-step logic. In contrast, a reasoning LLM will internalize or output a chain-of-thought (CoT) – a sequence of intermediate conclusions or calculations – before arriving at the answer ￼ ￼. Essentially, regular LLMs operate like an “I’m feeling lucky” one-shot guess, whereas reasoning LLMs take a methodical approach: they analyze, break down the question, reason through each part, and often double-check their solution before finalizing ￼.

Comparison of a basic LLM vs. a reasoning LLM on a simple task. The reasoning LLM provides an explanatory step-by-step solution instead of just a one-line answer ￼.

Key capabilities of reasoning LLMs:
	•	Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: They can carry out an internal dialogue or sequence of steps (“thinking aloud” in text) to solve problems. For example, to solve a math word problem, a reasoning LLM might first reason about which formula to use, then plug in numbers, then simplify, before giving the answer ￼.
	•	Self-Consistency and Checking: They often verify or refine their own answers. A reasoning model might notice if an answer seems inconsistent and revisit the problem (something standard LLMs wouldn’t do by themselves).
	•	Structured Outputs: Instead of just free-form text, they might produce structured reasoning (like lists of steps, numbered thoughts, or even a scratchpad calculation). This makes their output more interpretable and easier to debug.
	•	Better on Complex Tasks: Thanks to the above, reasoning LLMs tend to excel at tasks like multi-step math, logical puzzles, long-form planning, or code that requires tracking state, where standard models may falter or hallucinate steps.

Architectural/Training differences: Under the hood, reasoning LLMs are often based on the same transformer architectures as GPT-4 or LLaMA, but they undergo special training or use different inference techniques to encourage multi-step reasoning:
	•	Many are fine-tuned with chain-of-thought data (i.e. training examples that include the step-by-step reasoning in the prompt or output). This teaches the model how to think, not just what to answer ￼.
	•	They might use reinforcement learning (RL) to reward correct reasoning processes. For example, OpenAI’s first reasoning model “o1” was trained with large-scale RL to “teach the model how to think” productively ￼ ￼.
	•	Some have architectural tweaks: e.g. Mixture-of-Experts layers (as in DeepSeek-R1) to allocate more capacity per token ￼, or additional modules to verify steps.
	•	At inference time, they often allow more computation per query – for instance, generating multiple solutions and checking them, or performing a tree search through possible reasoning paths, whereas a normal LLM just generates one answer greedily.

In summary, a reasoning LLM is an LLM optimized for “how to think” rather than just “what to say” ￼. They spend more time “thinking” (sometimes taking a few seconds longer) but usually give more reliable and detailed answers on hard problems ￼. This trade-off between speed and reasoning power is a defining characteristic of these models. For instance, OpenAI’s documentation notes that if you need fast responses, a regular GPT-4 model may be better, but for “deep reasoning” tasks that can tolerate longer responses, the o1 model is preferable ￼.

Example: Reasoning vs. Non-Reasoning in Action

To make it concrete, consider a tricky riddle:

“George W. Bush visited all U.S. states except one. The name of that one state does not share any letter with ‘George W Bush.’ Which state is it?”

A standard model (like base GPT-4) might instantly blurt out an answer (“Ohio” in one real example) with high confidence – and be wrong ￼. A reasoning LLM, however, will approach systematically: it can list the letters in “George W Bush,” then iterate through state names, find the one with no overlapping letters, and arrive at the correct answer (“Indiana”). In fact, when this was tried at a dinner party, GPT-4 failed, but OpenAI’s o1 model “thought for a long while, shared its reasoning, and came up with the correct answer.” ￼. This highlights how reasoning LLMs shine where naive guessing fails.

2. Major Reasoning LLMs Today (Open & Closed Source)

Over the past year, several reasoning-optimized LLMs have emerged. Some are proprietary (closed-source) models offered via an API, while others are open-source projects. Below is a comparative summary of some major reasoning LLMs as of 2024–2025, including OpenAI’s models, DeepSeek’s model, and top open-source contenders.

Table: Leading Reasoning LLMs – Capabilities and Use Cases

Model	Type/Source	Strengths & Benchmarks	Intended Use Cases
OpenAI o1 (GPT-4o1)	Closed (OpenAI) – 2024	~Trained via RL for chain-of-thought. Excels at math, logic, coding challenges. Set new records on math benchmarks (e.g. GSM8K) ￼. Shows its reasoning steps (“hidden reasoning tokens”) and learns to correct mistakes ￼ ￼.	Complex problem solving where accuracy is crucial (science QA, engineering design), agent planning tasks, coding assistants that require debugging.
OpenAI o3	Closed (OpenAI) – 2025	Next-gen after o1 with even more reasoning depth. Higher performance but significantly slower and more compute-intensive (uses more inference-time “thinking”) ￼. On coding challenges, reportedly among top-50 programmers globally ￼.	Deep reasoning applications that can tolerate latency – e.g. research assistants, complex multi-hop question answering, difficult logical puzzles.
DeepSeek R1	Partially Open (DeepSeek, 2025)	671B-parameter Mixture-of-Experts model ￼ released by a Chinese lab. Matches or surpasses OpenAI’s o1 on many benchmarks ￼. Ranked #1 among open models on Chatbot Arena (as of Jan 2025) ￼. Extremely strong in math, physics, and coding; it essentially fact-checks itself to avoid common LLM pitfalls ￼. Also much more efficient: ~30× cost-efficient and 5× faster than o1 by design ￼.	Advanced analytics on enterprise data (paired with retrieval), scientific research (e.g. solving equations, analyzing experiments), large-scale coding or data transformation tasks. DeepSeek R1 is also used in a chatbot app that quickly rose to the top of app stores ￼, showing its practical impact.
Muir (open project)	Open Source (Community) – 2025	“Muir” is a nickname for a community-driven reasoning model effort (inspired by DeepSeek/O1). For example, one open project (led by Alastair Muir) demonstrated training a 500M param model to do reasoning with reinforcement learning ￼. It turned a tiny Qwen-0.5B model into a “math reasoning machine” solving GSM8K math problems. While much smaller in scale, it’s a proof-of-concept that even small LMs can learn step-by-step reasoning via RL.	Educational and experimental use. Muir’s approach is used to democratize reasoning techniques – e.g. letting researchers and enthusiasts fine-tune their own LLMs for reasoning on a budget. Not intended to compete with giant models, but great for learning and niche deployments (e.g. a math helper bot fine-tuned for a specific dataset).
Qwen QwQ-32B	Open Source (Alibaba, 2025)	A 32B parameter open model specialized in transparent reasoning. Combines strong fine-tuning with multimodal capability. Achieved 90.6% on MATH benchmark (extremely high for open models) ￼. Excellent at step-by-step math and code, and optimizes memory usage in multi-turn dialogues (avoids repeating itself) ￼. Competes with much larger models (like DeepSeek R1) despite smaller size ￼.	Use in domains needing rigorous multi-step reasoning without relying on closed APIs: e.g. financial analysis bots (showing their calculations), logic tutors, or self-hosted coding assistants. Its relatively moderate size (32B) makes it (somewhat) easier to deploy than 100B+ models.
OpenBMB Eurus-70B (and 7B)	Open Source (OpenBMB Lab, 2024)	A suite of models (7B up to 70B) optimized for reasoning via preference learning. Eurus-70B is reported to outperform GPT-3.5 Turbo on reasoning benchmarks ￼, and even the small Eurus-7B outperforms some 30B models ￼. Focuses on math (GSM8K, MATH datasets) and code reasoning. Uses innovative fine-tuning algorithms (UltraInteract, etc.).	Scenarios where an open, smaller model is preferred (for cost or data privacy) but one still needs high reasoning performance: e.g. an on-premises assistant that can handle internal business logic or a tutoring system for math proofs. The 7B version can even run on a single high-end GPU, making reasoning AI more accessible.
Google Gemini 2.0 “Flash”	Closed (Google/DeepMind, 2025)	Google’s latest flagship (multimodal) model with a “flash” reasoning mode. Twice as fast as its predecessor and notably improved in reasoning abilities ￼. It uses test-time compute scaling (“flash thinking”) to boost reasoning without needing a larger model. (Details are proprietary.) Shown strong performance in long-context reasoning (reading comprehension) and multimodal reasoning tasks ￼.	Enterprise virtual assistants that see and reason (since Gemini can handle images+text), advanced planning tasks (e.g. robotics or game AI that needs quick but reasoned decisions), and any applications in Google’s ecosystem that demand top-notch reasoning with relatively low latency.

Notes: This is not an exhaustive list; new models and versions are emerging rapidly. Other notable mentions include OpenAI’s GPT-4 Turbo (unaugmented) – while not explicitly a “reasoning model,” it’s often the baseline to beat and can engage in reasoning if prompted. Anthropic’s Claude 2 isn’t specifically a chain-of-thought model, but it has some improved reasoning over earlier GPT-3 class models (Claude Next versions might incorporate more reasoning abilities). Additionally, research prototypes like Stanford’s “s1” (32B) have explored pure reinforcement learning from scratch for reasoning ￼ – showing that even without a starting large model, an agent can learn reasoning by trial and error (though s1 is a research model, not widely used in industry).

Finally, keep in mind that “closed vs open” has practical implications: closed models (like o1/o3 or Gemini) might have usage fees and limits, but are turn-key to use via API. Open models (like DeepSeek R1’s weights or Qwen QwQ) can be self-hosted for free, but often require huge computational resources to run, unless distilled to smaller versions. In practice, many companies use a combination: e.g. a powerful closed model for the hardest queries and a local open model for simpler or privacy-sensitive tasks.

3. Using Reasoning LLMs Effectively

Getting the most out of a reasoning-capable model involves more than just calling it like any other LLM. You’ll want to craft your prompts and system in a way that leverages the model’s step-by-step strengths. In this section, we cover best practices in prompt engineering for reasoning, special patterns like Chain-of-Thought and self-reflection, how to incorporate tools/memory, and integrating these models into larger systems (like Retrieval-Augmented Generation and agents).

3.1 Prompt Engineering Best Practices for Reasoning

Ask for the reasoning: The simplest trick is to explicitly prompt the model to “think step by step” or “show your reasoning”. Even non-reasoning models often do better with such prompts ￼, and reasoning models are usually trained to respond to these cues. For example:
	•	Zero-shot CoT: Append a phrase like “Let’s think this through step by step.” at the end of your question. This is known to trigger many models into a chain-of-thought mode ￼.
	•	Format the answer request: e.g. “First, explain your reasoning, then give the final answer on a new line.” This ensures the model knows to output its thought process followed by a concise answer.
	•	Use system messages (for APIs): If using OpenAI’s API with a reasoning model, you can put something in the system message like: “You are a logical reasoner. Solve problems by breaking them into steps, and double-check your work.” This sets the general behavior from the start.

Few-shot examples: Providing one or two examples of a worked solution in the prompt can help guide the model. For instance, you might show a QA pair where the reasoning is laid out, then ask your actual question. Because reasoning models have usually seen such formats during fine-tuning, this can improve performance. (Be mindful of model context length though—don’t overload with too many examples.)

Clarity and specificity: Clearly specify the format you want. If you need the chain-of-thought in a particular structure (say, a bulleted list of steps), ask for it. The same goes for using special delimiters or tags if you plan to parse the reasoning later.

Avoiding leakage of the answer: One thing to watch – when including examples, use a separator like --- or a different role (system vs. user) to ensure the model doesn’t mistakenly blend the example’s answer with the new query. Also ensure the example’s solution isn’t trivially copyable to the real question (different numbers, etc.), or the model might just mimic it.

Prompt for correctness checking: Some reasoning models respond well if you prompt them to check their answer. For instance: “If the answer seems wrong, reconsider the reasoning and try a different approach.” Models like o1 were explicitly trained to “recognize and correct mistakes” in their chain-of-thought ￼. So a user prompt encouraging that behavior can activate an extra round of reflection.

In general, treat the prompt to a reasoning LLM as both the question and an invitation to solve it like a mini-workshop. You’re basically saying: “Don’t just answer – walk me through how to answer.” Good prompting can make a huge difference in utilizing the full power of these models.

3.2 Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Self-Reflection Patterns

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is the core pattern behind reasoning LLMs. It means the model generates intermediate reasoning steps. As a user or developer, you can interact with this chain in various ways:
	•	Visible vs Hidden CoT: Some closed models (like OpenAI’s o1) generate a hidden chain-of-thought that isn’t directly shown to the user by default (used internally to get the answer). Most open setups and some API options will show the reasoning in the output if prompted. If you want to see it, make sure to ask for it in the prompt. Seeing the chain can be useful for debugging the model’s logic or even extracting an explanation for end-users. In other cases (e.g., an exam-grading scenario) you might want the chain hidden but still use it internally.
	•	Self-reflection loop: This is an extension where the model not only produces reasoning, but then reflects on it and possibly revises its answer. A simple way to implement this: after the model gives an answer with reasoning, you can feed that back in and ask, “Is there any mistake in the above reasoning? If so, correct it and give a final answer.” Many reasoning LLMs will happily critque their own prior output and fix errors. In fact, part of the training for models like o1 included learning to backtrack when a path isn’t working ￼.
	•	Multiple reasoning paths (self-consistency): A known technique is to sample several chains of thought (by setting a higher temperature or using an ensemble of model runs) and then see if they converge on the same answer. This is called self-consistency. Reasoning models often benefit from this because one chain might go wrong at step 3, another might go wrong at step 5, but if 3 out of 5 chains arrive at “42” as the answer, that’s likely correct ￼. You can automate this: generate N answers with reasoning, then pick the most common final answer. This has been shown to improve accuracy on math questions compared to a single shot.
	•	Plan-and-solve prompts: Another pattern is to explicitly separate the planning from the solving. You can first ask the model to outline a plan (steps) without solving, and then in a second stage, execute each step. For example: “Plan: [list the steps to solve]. Then carry out the plan step by step.” Some frameworks allow the model to internally plan (not shown to user) and then execute (this is how many agent frameworks operate, which we’ll discuss soon). But you can also do it in a straightforward prompt if the model is capable.

Encouraging reflection: Phrases like “Does the result make sense? If not, reconsider.” can prompt the model to double-check. A reasoning LLM often has the ability to notice obvious wrong results (like a calculation error) upon reflection. For instance, you might see it say: “I got 17 for X, but that seems off because if I plug it back in, it doesn’t satisfy the conditions… Let me try a different approach.” This kind of self-correction is gold – it’s exactly what we want from a reasoning engine, and it’s something you rarely see in a basic LLM.

Summary of patterns:
	•	Use CoT prompting (“think step by step”) to get intermediate steps ￼.
	•	Use self-reflection prompts (“check if the answer is correct”) to have the model validate or revise its reasoning.
	•	Consider multi-pass approaches: multiple independent solutions then aggregate (for confidence).
	•	Clearly separate planning from execution if needed to handle very complex sequences.

These patterns help mitigate the risk of a single reasoning chain going astray. Even with a powerful model, complex reasoning can veer off track if an early assumption is wrong. By introducing reflection and multiple attempts, you give the model a chance to correct course.

3.3 Role of Tool Use and Memory

One exciting aspect of reasoning LLMs is how well they can integrate with external tools and use working memory. Think of a reasoning LLM as the “brain” – it can decide what needs to be done – and tools as the “hands” – actions like using a calculator, doing a web search, running code, etc., to carry out specific tasks.

Tool use (augmentation): Many advanced reasoning setups involve giving the model access to tools. For example:
	•	A calculator or Python interpreter for math (so the model doesn’t make arithmetic mistakes, it can offload precise calculation).
	•	A knowledge base or web search for fact-finding (so the model can find fresh or detailed information rather than relying purely on memorized training data).
	•	Other APIs (e.g. a calendar for scheduling tasks, a translator, etc.)

Reasoning models are particularly good at knowing when and how to use a tool if you design the interaction right. A famous approach is the ReAct pattern (Reason + Act) where the model’s chain-of-thought can include tool calls. For instance, the CoT might look like: “Step 2: I should search for X” and the system will actually do the search and feed results back to the model, which then continues reasoning with that information. There’s also the concept of Tree-of-Thoughts and planning algorithms where the LLM explores different tool-using branches to solve a problem ￼.

Memory (long context & scratchpads): By memory we mean both short-term scratchpad and longer-term context:
	•	Scratchpad: A reasoning LLM may benefit from using a scratchpad to store intermediate results (like variables in a math solution or assumptions in a logical proof). In practice, this can be just part of the text conversation. For example, you explicitly tell the model: “Let’s define variables for these quantities and derive relationships.” The model writes them down, effectively storing that info for later steps. Some agent frameworks maintain a structured scratchpad the model can append to.
	•	Long-term memory: This could be implemented via vector databases or other memory modules in an agent. For instance, after solving several sub-tasks, the system might summarize and feed that summary back in when the model tackles a higher-level task. Reasoning models with long context (like 32k or even 100k tokens, e.g. Claude or special versions of GPT) can directly “remember” a lot in their prompt window, which is helpful for multi-step reasoning over long documents.
	•	Memory optimization: Interestingly, models like Qwen QwQ have been optimized to retain relevant info without repeating it in multi-turn dialogues ￼. This means if the model figured out a fact in Step 3, it will carry it to Step 7 reliably. This is a huge plus for complex reasoning. As a user, you should still recap key points occasionally or use the system’s memory tool, especially if the conversation is extremely long (to avoid context window overflow).

Designing a tool-using reasoning system: If you’re building an autonomous agent (e.g., something that answers questions by searching the web and then writing an answer), using a reasoning LLM at the core is powerful. You might set up a loop like:

While not done:
   1. Get model's output (which might be a thought or an action).
   2. If it's an action (e.g. "SEARCH(query)"), execute the tool and get result.
   3. Feed result back into model, continue reasoning.
   4. If it's a final answer, output it.

Reasoning LLMs are well-suited to this because they produce the rationale for each action. For example, DeepMind’s “FlashThink” paradigm in Gemini likely involves the model deciding how to allocate compute or which “flash” of insight to focus on ￼. And a recent paper Search-R1 specifically trained a model to do web search as part of its reasoning process ￼.

Important: From a prompt standpoint, if you want your model to use tools, you need to format its outputs in a way that your code can detect. This often means using a special syntax or token (like <tool> query </tool> or something) in the model’s response. Many open-source agent frameworks (LangChain, etc.) provide out-of-the-box support for this by constraining the model’s outputs or by parsing the chain-of-thought.

In summary, tool use extends a reasoning LLM’s capabilities beyond what it was trained on, and memory (in the sense of context management) allows it to handle more complex, extended tasks. When paired with tools, a reasoning LLM can resemble an “AI agent” that not only plans and thinks, but also acts and observes results, leading to a powerful feedback loop for solving problems.

3.4 Integration into RAG and Autonomous Agents

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): In a RAG setup, the model is provided with relevant documents or facts retrieved from a database or search, to help it answer a query. Reasoning LLMs integrate beautifully with RAG because they can logically combine retrieved pieces of information. For example, say you have a large knowledge base and a complex question that requires piecing together info from multiple documents – a reasoning model will handle the multi-hop reasoning needed: “From Doc1 we got X, from Doc2 we got Y, thus the answer is Z.” They are less likely to hallucinate because they can be instructed to base each step on the provided texts.

When using RAG:
	•	Ensure the prompt encourages the model to cite or refer to the retrieved info in its reasoning. You might say: “Use the provided context to support each step of your reasoning.”
	•	Because reasoning models can be slower, you might retrieve fewer but high-quality chunks (since the model will actually take time to read them carefully).
	•	Some reasoning models are explicitly designed for retrieval scenarios. For instance, DeepSeek R1 is noted as being great at integrating with enterprise data via RAG ￼ – it can ingest personal data and reason about it securely. This is a very strong use case: feeding customer data and having the model reason out a personalized solution or report, with each step grounded in the data.

Autonomous agents: These are systems where the LLM is in a loop of generating actions (which could include using tools, as discussed, or even self-directed next steps). Examples include AI agents like AutoGPT, BabyAGI, or custom workflows where the model can, say, write code, execute it, observe the output, and fix errors.

Reasoning LLMs are often the preferred “brain” for agents because agents inherently require multi-step planning. If you’ve heard of agents getting stuck or making silly mistakes, a lot of that is mitigated by having a model that naturally thinks in steps and can self-correct.

When integrating into an agent:
	•	Decide how the chain-of-thought will be used. In some designs, the chain-of-thought is shown to the user (for transparency). In others, it’s hidden and only the final actions or answers are shown.
	•	Set up “guardrails” or monitors for the reasoning process. For instance, you might have a rule: if the model hasn’t reached a solution in 10 steps, then reset or ask a different model to critique. This prevents infinite loops or dithering.
	•	Leverage the model’s strengths: a reasoning LLM can do higher-level planning (like breaking a goal into sub-goals). You might even use a two-model system: one model (planner) outlines the approach, and the same or another model (solver) executes the steps. Because these reasoning models are so capable, often a single instance can do both, but sometimes dividing responsibilities can mimic a team-of-agents scenario.

Case in point: A legal assistant agent might use a reasoning LLM to plan out how to analyze a contract: “First, read section 1 for liabilities, then section 2 for obligations, compare them, and finally draft a summary.” It will then carry out these steps, possibly retrieving relevant laws or definitions in between. Without a reasoning model, a naive agent might just jump into the text and produce a generic summary missing the nuances; the reasoning agent, however, will methodically ensure each aspect is covered, making it far more reliable for professional use.

Performance considerations: Integrating reasoning models in agents and RAG pipelines can be computationally heavy. Each step the model “thinks” is usually additional tokens, which means more latency. For example, an o1 model might already be slower per token than GPT-4, and if it’s producing a long chain-of-thought, that adds overhead. Solutions include using a smaller reasoning model if possible, or limiting the chain length via prompt instructions like: “Don’t use more than 5 steps unless necessary.” However, often the improved correctness is worth the extra seconds of processing when the task is complex.

To wrap up this section: Reasoning models thrive in structured, multi-step scenarios. Use them in situations where you want the AI to not just answer, but figure things out. Prompt them in a way that unleashes their logical abilities, allow them to use tools and memory when needed, and they can become incredibly powerful components of larger AI systems.

4. Hands-On: Code Templates and Exercises

Now let’s get our hands dirty with some coding examples! In this section, we provide Python code snippets and mini-exercises to illustrate how to set up and use reasoning LLMs, run reasoning-specific tasks and benchmarks, and experiment with prompting strategies. Even if you can’t execute these here, you can use them as templates for your own Jupyter notebooks or projects.

Note: For proprietary models (like OpenAI’s), you’ll need API access and credentials. For open-source models, you’ll need sufficient hardware (or use a hosted inference API) to run them. We’ll show examples of both.

4.1 Using a Reasoning Model via API (OpenAI o1 example)

Let’s assume you have access to OpenAI’s o1 model. Using the openai Python package, you can query it similar to how you’d query GPT-4. The difference is just specifying the model name (OpenAI’s documentation would give you the exact identifier, e.g. "gpt-4o1-preview" or similar).

import openai

openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"  # replace with your actual key

# Let's ask a reasoning question:
question = "A car travels 150 miles in 3 hours. Then it travels 100 miles in 2 hours. " \
           "What is the car's average speed over the entire trip? " \
           "Think step by step."

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="openai-o1-preview",  # hypothetical model identifier for o1
    messages=[
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful reasoning AI. Solve problems step by step."},
      {"role": "user", "content": question}
    ],
    temperature=0  # deterministically follow reasoning
)
answer = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
print(answer)

In this snippet, we prompt the model to “Think step by step” in the user query itself. We also set temperature=0 to reduce randomness, since for a math question we want a consistent solution. The system message is nudging the model’s behavior to ensure it knows we expect reasoning. The model should output something like:

First, find total distance: 150 + 100 = 250 miles.
Next, find total time: 3 + 2 = 5 hours.
Average speed = total distance / total time = 250 / 5 = 50 miles per hour.
Therefore, the average speed is 50 mph.

Followed by maybe a final answer sentence. That step-by-step breakdown is exactly what we want to see. (If we had used a regular GPT-4 without reasoning, it might still solve this, but a reasoning model will be more explicit and reliable, especially on trickier problems.)

Exercise: Try modifying the question to something like a puzzle or a multi-step logical deduction and see how the model responds. For instance: “If Alice is older than Bob, and Bob is older than Carol, and Carol is not the youngest, who is the oldest? Explain your reasoning.” Compare the clarity of o1’s reasoning to what you get from a standard model.

4.2 Running an Open-Source Reasoning Model (Hugging Face Transformers)

For open-source models, let’s consider the Eurus-7B model from OpenBMB (as mentioned earlier). It’s one of the smaller reasoning models that can run on a single GPU. We’ll use the Hugging Face transformers library to load and run it. (Ensure you have the model weights – either by installing transformers and letting it download, or using the Hugging Face Hub.)

import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

model_name = "openbmb/Eurus-7b-sft"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
model.to("cuda")  # move to GPU if available

# Formulate a prompt in the style the model expects.
# Eurus was fine-tuned in an instruction format (similar to LLaMA etc.)
prompt = "[INST] Solve the following math problem step-by-step.\n" \
         "If a train is moving at 60 mph and travels for 3 hours, how far does it go?\n[/INST]"

inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=200, do_sample=False)
result = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(result)

In this code:
	•	We load the 7B model and its tokenizer. We use bfloat16 (or we could use float16) to save memory. We assume a GPU is available. If not, you could do .to("cpu") but generation will be very slow for a 7B model on CPU.
	•	We craft a prompt in the format the model expects. Many open instruction-tuned models use special tokens like "<s>[INST]" and "[/INST]" around the user instruction. We include the instruction to solve step-by-step. This matches the UltraInteract format mentioned in the Eurus README ￼.
	•	We call generate to produce the answer, without sampling (do_sample=False makes it deterministic, using greedy or beam search).
	•	After decoding, we print the result.

The expected output would be a step-by-step solution:

To find the distance, use the formula distance = speed * time.
Speed = 60 mph, time = 3 hours.
Distance = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.
So the train travels 180 miles.

(This is a simple one; Eurus can handle much harder problems too.)

Exercise: After you get it working, try a more challenging problem for Eurus-7B, like a multi-step arithmetic word problem or a simple coding challenge (you can prompt it to write code as well). Observe how it lays out the reasoning. If it makes a mistake, see if you can prompt it to correct itself.

Tips: If the model’s output is truncated or it stops reasoning midway, you might need to adjust max_new_tokens. Also, some open models might require enabling model.eval() or adjusting generation settings (like temperature, top_p) to get the best performance. For reasoning tasks, starting with deterministic (temperature=0) is often good to see the baseline reasoning.

4.3 Running Reasoning-Specific Benchmarks or Tasks

One way to evaluate a reasoning model is to run it on a known benchmark dataset, such as GSM8K (a math word problem dataset) or some logic puzzles, and check accuracy. Here’s a small example of how you might do that in a notebook:

# Suppose we have a list of test questions and answers:
test_questions = [
    "If a dozen eggs cost $3, how much do two dozen eggs cost?",
    "John has 5 apples and eats 2, then buys 7 more. How many apples does he have now?"
]
expected_answers = [
    "Two dozen would cost $6.",  # or just "6 dollars"
    "He has 10 apples now."      # explanation: 5-2+7 = 10
]

for question, expected in zip(test_questions, expected_answers):
    prompt = f"[INST] {question}\nExplain your reasoning and give the answer.\n[/INST]"
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
    outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=150)
    result = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    print(f"Q: {question}\nModel's answer: {result}\nExpected: {expected}\n{'-'*40}")

This will prompt the model on each question, asking for explanation and answer. We then print the model’s answer and the expected answer for comparison. This is a rudimentary check (for a real benchmark, you’d want to parse the answer and compare programmatically, ignoring minor format differences).

Exercise: Extend this idea. Create a list of, say, 5 arithmetic word problems. See how many the model gets correct. Then try the same with the OpenAI API for GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 without CoT and compare accuracy. You might find the reasoning model (even the 7B one) does surprisingly well if the problems require multi-step calculation where a non-reasoning model might stumble or forget a step.

For an advanced exercise, if you have access to multiple models, you could implement a mini evaluation where each model is asked the same set of questions (with CoT prompting) and you tally the scores. This can illustrate the difference in reasoning performance between, say, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and your open model.

4.4 Prompting Strategies Experiment

Let’s do a quick experiment: prompting with vs. without chain-of-thought. We’ll use a single question and see the difference.

q = "Mary needs to schedule 3 meetings. Each meeting is 30 minutes and she has a 2-hour block free. " \
    "If she also needs a 15-minute break after each meeting, can she fit all 3 meetings in the block?"

# Prompt 1: Direct answer
prompt1 = f"[INST] {q}\nAnswer directly.\n[/INST]"

# Prompt 2: With chain-of-thought
prompt2 = f"[INST] {q}\nThink step by step and then answer.\n[/INST]"

for i, prompt in enumerate([prompt1, prompt2], start=1):
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
    output = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=100)
    answer = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    print(f"Prompt {i} output:\n{answer}\n")

In this scenario, the correct answer is No, she cannot, because 3 meetings of 30m = 90m, plus 2 breaks of 15m (since after the third she doesn’t need a break) = 120m exactly, but actually with 3 breaks it’d be 90 + 45 = 135m which is over 2 hours. Let’s see how the model handles it.

Expected: With the direct prompt, a weaker model might just guess or say “Yes” or “No” without explanation (possibly even the wrong guess). With the CoT prompt, the model should layout: e.g. “3 meetings = 90 min, breaks = 152 = 30 min (if she doesn’t break after the last?), total = 120 min, which equals 2 hours, so actually it’s just enough if only 2 breaks, etc.”* The reasoning can be a bit subtle. The goal is to see if the chain-of-thought helps the model avoid a mistake.

Exercise: Try this with a model like GPT-3.5 via the OpenAI API to see the difference. Often GPT-3.5 might quickly answer something without carefully computing the breaks, whereas a reasoning model or GPT-4 with CoT will do the math step by step.

4.5 Error Analysis with Reasoning Models

One advantage of having the chain-of-thought is that when the model does make an error, you can often pinpoint where it went wrong. Let’s say the model gave an incorrect answer to a question. You can analyze its reasoning trace:

For example, suppose a model answered a math problem incorrectly. You see in its output it did: “I think X = 12 and Y = 5, then X+Y = 17” but actually X+Y should be 15. The error is clear in the reasoning (mis-addition). This is easier to diagnose than a single number “17” with no explanation.

In code or practice: You can programmatically extract intermediate steps and check them. For instance, some advanced workflows:
	•	After getting the chain-of-thought, pass parts of it (like any math expressions) to a calculator to verify. If the model said 7*8 = 54 in its reasoning, you catch it by evaluating 7*8 yourself.
	•	Use unit tests for reasoning: For a coding task, if the model explains its approach in steps, you can test each step’s outcome. In an agent, this might be done by the agent itself with code execution tools.

While we won’t write a full error-analysis script here, keep this mindset:
	1.	Always read the chain-of-thought – often the mistake is a single flawed assumption or calculation.
	2.	If deploying, you might even instruct the model to double-check its steps explicitly as part of its final answer (e.g. “verify each step above, then conclude”).

Exercise: Intentionally feed the model a question that it’s likely to mess up (maybe a very tricky math one or a riddled with a trap). See if you can spot the error in its reasoning. Then feed back a correction: “You assumed X but that’s wrong because… Please fix your solution.” This mimics how a human tutor might correct a student – the model, being a good reasoning engine, should integrate that feedback and arrive at the right answer.

By engaging in these coding exercises, you not only see how to use reasoning LLMs in practice but also how to systematically evaluate and improve their performance via prompting and analysis.

5. A Framework for Selecting, Testing, and Refining Reasoning Models

When faced with a project that could benefit from a reasoning LLM, how do you go about choosing the right model and setting it up for success? This section provides a mental model and practical framework, covering key factors to consider, evaluation strategies, and experimentation guidelines.

5.1 Factors to Consider in Selecting a Reasoning LLM
	•	Latency and Throughput: Reasoning models can be slow. More reasoning steps = more tokens to generate = higher latency. If your application is real-time (e.g. a live chatbot), using a large, heavy reasoning model might be problematic. OpenAI’s own guidance suggests using GPT-4 or GPT-4 Turbo for faster responses, but o1 for deeper reasoning when speed is less critical ￼. So ask: Is it okay if the response takes a few extra seconds? If yes, you can afford a more powerful reasoning model or enabling multi-step generation. If not, maybe use a smaller reasoning model or only enable CoT on certain queries.
	•	Interpretability: One big advantage of reasoning LLMs is interpretability – you get a rationale. If your use case requires explanations (e.g. legal or medical AI that must show how it arrived at advice), lean towards models that output their chain-of-thought clearly. Some closed models might not allow you to see the reasoning (if they have a hidden process). In such cases, an open model that outputs everything, or a prompt that forces the reasoning to be output, will be preferable. Also, if you need to justify decisions to stakeholders, a reasoning trace is useful.
	•	Reliability and Accuracy: This is often the top factor. Different models have different “trustworthiness” profiles. For example, DeepSeek R1 was noted to avoid many pitfalls of earlier models ￼ – likely meaning it hallucinates less on factual queries and makes fewer logical errors on tricky inputs. Check benchmarks relevant to your domain (e.g. MMLU for knowledge, GSM8K for math, HumanEval for code, Big-Bench for logic puzzles). Also consider the maturity of the model – early preview models might be buggy. Always read technical reports: if OpenAI or DeepSeek or others say “we consider X an unsuccessful attempt” ￼, it hints at what methods didn’t work for them (and thus where the model might still struggle).
	•	Complexity vs. Simplicity: Do you need a fancy reasoning model at all? Sometimes a well-prompted GPT-4 can handle the task with a bit of chain-of-thought. The more complex the model or system (e.g., one that does tree search, self-reflection, etc.), the harder it may be to maintain, and more points of failure. Aim for the simplest approach that achieves the required performance. For instance, if a task is moderately complex, a single-step solution from a high-quality model might suffice. If it’s very complex (multi-hop with tool use), that’s when the specialized reasoning models and architectures truly shine.
	•	Cost (Compute/Budget): Large models (like 70B, 130B, or 671B MoE) require significant compute resources. If using an API, cost is per token – reasoning models produce more tokens (all that reasoning text) and possibly have higher pricing per token. If self-hosting, consider GPU memory and throughput. You might consider distilled or smaller versions: e.g. DeepSeek released R1-Distill which fine-tuned smaller Qwen and Llama models on R1’s outputs ￼. These smaller models try to approximate the big model’s reasoning at a fraction of cost. They might not be as good, but could be “good enough” for many cases. Always match the model scale to your budget and volume needs.
	•	Domain Specificity: Some reasoning models are general-purpose, while others might be tilted to domains (like code, math, or medicine). For example, the o1-Coder model was an OpenAI o1 replication specialized for programming tasks ￼. If your use case is, say, mostly coding, you might prefer a model or variant tuned for that (because it might have tools or libraries in mind, etc.). Likewise, a model like Qwen QvQ (if we interpret from the article title) might be specialized for certain verticals. So, check if there’s a reasoning model variant aimed at your domain.

Trade-off thinking: It’s rarely a one-size-fits-all. You might end up with a hybrid approach: e.g. using a fast model for simple queries and switching to a reasoning model for complex ones. Or using a reasoning model to generate a solution and a faster model to paraphrase the answer nicely. The key is to align the model’s strengths with the problem’s requirements.

5.2 Evaluation Strategies

When you have a reasoning model in the loop, evaluating it involves looking not just at final answers but also at the intermediate reasoning quality. Here are strategies:
	•	Unit tests for reasoning steps: If the model produces a chain-of-thought with distinct steps (especially in tools or code), you can sometimes test each step. For instance, if one step is “Therefore, X = 15 (since 3*5=15)”, you can verify that with a simple script. Or if it’s solving a puzzle, verify that the clues used at each step are factually from the input. This is akin to unit testing a multi-step solution.
	•	End-to-end accuracy: Ultimately, check if the final answers are correct/appropriate. You might use standard metrics: accuracy for math/Q&A, BLEU or ROUGE for explanations (if comparing to a reference), etc. But be careful: a reasoning model might produce a correct answer with a verbose explanation that doesn’t word-match a reference. So, you might need to evaluate final answers manually or with a tolerant criterion.
	•	Reasoning robustness tests: Change something in the question that shouldn’t affect the logical method and see if the reasoning still holds. For example, if a date in a problem changes but the answer logically shouldn’t, does the model adapt correctly? This can catch if the model is overfitting to surface patterns.
	•	Regression tests: Once you have a prompt and model setup that works on a set of test cases, save those cases as regression tests. If you update the prompt or switch model versions later, run these tests to ensure nothing important broke. E.g. you might have 20 hand-crafted complex queries your system must handle; keep their expected outputs. If a new model version gets 18/20 right whereas the old got 20/20, investigate those 2 fails.
	•	Synthetic data for evaluation: You can generate tricky questions systematically to probe the model. For instance, create arithmetic problems where one number is deliberately large (to test if it can handle big calculations or needs a tool), or logic puzzles with varying numbers of steps. Synthetic doesn’t replace real benchmarks, but it helps stress-test specific reasoning capabilities in a controlled way.
	•	Human-in-the-loop evaluation: Because reasoning traces are readable, human evaluators can be employed to rate how sensible the reasoning was, even if the final answer is right. This can uncover cases where the model got the right answer for the wrong reason (which might indicate a lucky guess). If deploying in a high-stakes scenario, having domain experts review a sample of the model’s reasoning outputs can be very insightful.

Metrics to consider: For final answers, metrics like accuracy or F1 (for QA), or pass rate (for coding problems) are common. For the reasoning process, there is research into metrics like “step correctness” or using model-based evaluators (e.g., another AI that judges reasoning steps). If you have a well-defined task (like a math proof), you could even write a checker to verify each step logically follows (though that’s complex for general text).

One interesting approach: use a “reasoning judge” model. Researchers have tried having a separate model (or the same model in a different mode) evaluate the chain-of-thought of the first model for correctness ￼. OpenAI hinted at something similar by training an Outcome Reward Model to rate reasoning ￼. This is advanced, but worth knowing: you can automate some evaluation of reasoning quality, not just outcome.

5.3 Experimentation Guidelines

Finally, how to systematically experiment and refine your reasoning model setup:
	•	Prompt trees: Just like hyperparameter tuning, you can do prompt tuning. Create a “tree” of prompt variations. For example, variant A: “Think step by step”, variant B: “Let’s solve this together, reasoning it out:”, variant C: add an example, etc. Run a set of problems through each and see which yields the best results. You might find one phrasing that consistently leads to better reasoning. Keep those prompts handy as templates.
	•	Few-shot vs. zero-shot: Try both. Few-shot may boost performance but at cost of prompt length. If using few-shot, experiment with how many examples and how they’re presented (concise ones are better). Multi-shot (many examples) can sometimes overwhelm or cause the model to overfit to patterns in those examples. There’s often a sweet spot (maybe 2-3 examples).
	•	Temperature and sampling: Although for deterministic reasoning we often use temperature=0, exploring a bit of randomness can discover alternative solutions. For example, if you suspect the model is getting stuck in a flawed reasoning path every time, try a higher temperature to see if it finds a different path. This is essentially a form of brainstorming. You can then pick the best result. Some practitioners run a model at temp ~0.7 to generate 5 different reasoning chains, then pick the one that seems most plausible or the majority answer – this combines experimentation with self-consistency voting.
	•	Model scale experiments: If you have access to different sizes (like a 7B vs 70B of the same family, or GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5 vs o1), test how they differ on your tasks. It might turn out the 7B with CoT does almost as well as the 70B without, which is useful to know. Generally, reasoning ability improves with model size and with special training. But a well-trained smaller model can beat a larger generic model on structured reasoning ￼. So don’t assume you need the biggest model – experiment!
	•	Complexity vs. performance plots: As you increase the complexity of the reasoning (longer chains, more tools, etc.), track performance. You might see diminishing returns or a sweet spot. For example, you might find that allowing up to 5 reasoning steps is optimal, but beyond 5 steps, the model starts rambling and making mistakes (perhaps error compounds or it loses focus). That would mean you should constrain it to ~5 steps via prompt or stopping criteria.
	•	A/B testing with users: If this model will face users (say as part of a chatbot or decision support tool), do A/B tests. One version with reasoning enabled (and maybe the chain shown as explanation) vs one without. Measure user satisfaction, success at tasks, etc. Sometimes the differences only truly come out with real users – maybe users trust the reasoning model more because it shows working, or maybe they find the extra verbosity annoying (which you can fix by giving a more concise final answer while keeping reasoning internal). Such feedback will guide you on refining how the reasoning is presented or used.

Closing the loop: Use evaluation results to refine prompts or choose another model, then re-evaluate. For instance, if you notice many reasoning errors of a specific kind (say, the model often forgets a break in scheduling problems), you can integrate a rule or an extra prompt nudge about that scenario. If one model just isn’t cutting it in a certain category, consider a different model or an ensemble (maybe use one model’s output as input for another, etc., though that gets complex).

In essence, treat the development with a reasoning LLM like you would a software project: test often, analyze failures, tweak and iterate. The interpretability of reasoning models is a huge boon here – it’s much easier to debug why it got something wrong, compared to a black-box that just says “42” with no explanation. Use that to your advantage.

6. Real-World Applications and Case Studies

Reasoning LLMs are more than just academic curiosities – they are being applied in various industries and scenarios. Here we’ll highlight some usage examples across different domains to inspire you and show practical benefits:
	•	Search and Information Retrieval: Companies are integrating reasoning LLMs into search engines and knowledge bases so that the AI can not only retrieve documents but also analyze and synthesize answers. For example, a reasoning model can perform a multi-document summary by logically connecting facts from different sources. If one doc says “X causes Y” and another says “Y causes Z,” the model can conclude “X leads to Z” and explain that chain. This is deeper than traditional search, which might return those two docs separately. Startups are also using reasoning LLMs to power chatbots over documentation – the model will fetch relevant docs (RAG style) and then reason about the user’s question with the fetched info, yielding answers that involve non-trivial deduction (like figuring out which product configuration meets a set of constraints, referencing various spec sheets).
	•	Agents and Task Automation: Autonomous agent frameworks (like those built on GPT-4 or open models) often rely on reasoning to decide next actions. For instance, an AI assistant agent might plan a complex travel itinerary: it uses reasoning to compare options (flights, hotels, routes) given constraints (budget, schedule) and perhaps uses tools (calls an API for flight prices). The chain-of-thought might include evaluating trade-offs (“This flight is cheaper but has a long layover, which violates the user’s time constraint, so skip that option.”). Without a reasoning model, the agent might pick suboptimal or incorrect actions. With one, it can genuinely plan like a human would. This is seen in many experimental personal assistant bots and also in back-end process automation in businesses (where the AI handles multi-step workflows).
	•	Legal Reasoning: Legal questions often involve applying rules to facts in a structured way – exactly what reasoning LLMs excel at. Some law tech companies use LLMs to analyze contracts or case law. For example, given a complex scenario, a reasoning LLM can outline the legal reasoning: identify relevant clauses, precedents, then deduce the outcome. It might say: “Clause 5.2 says A, and in case XYZ vs ABC it was held that B, therefore in this situation the liability falls on Party X.” This chain-of-thought is extremely valuable in legal settings where explainability is a must. Early case studies show LLMs (with CoT prompting) can pass law exams or draft legal arguments with decent quality. A closed model like GPT-4 can do this, but a reasoning-optimized model might do it more systematically and avoid logical mistakes in the argument.
	•	Scientific Research and Discovery: In scientific domains (like chemistry, physics, biology), reasoning LLMs are helping researchers navigate complex problems. For instance, in drug discovery, a reasoning model can plan experiments or reason about molecular interactions by breaking the problem into steps (though they don’t replace wet lab, they assist hypothesis generation). There are efforts to use LLMs to solve hard physics problems or proofs – models like DeepMind’s AlphaCode or others for math. DeepSeek R1’s creators mention its use in things like genomic analysis and large-scale simulations ￼, suggesting it can interpret complex patterns and deduce results (perhaps by reasoning about data or experimental conditions). In a case study, a reasoning LLM was tasked with analyzing a physics word problem – it wrote out the equations and solved it, where a normal model would often guess a formula and likely err.
	•	Business Planning and Strategy: Some companies are exploring AI to support decision-making. A reasoning model could be used to analyze a business scenario: e.g., “Our sales dropped 10% this quarter, list possible reasons and steps to investigate”. The model might come up with a chain-of-thought: “Possible reasons: (1) Market downturn (check economic data), (2) new competitor (check industry news), (3) internal supply issues (review inventory reports). Step-by-step: First look at economic indicators…”. This is like having an analyst that not only gives you data but also a reasoning path. While it might not fully replace human analysts, it can save time by doing first-pass reasoning through tons of data or reports.
	•	Code Generation and Debugging: Reasoning LLMs have made a splash in coding. Models like OpenAI’s Codex or CodeLlama are great, but reasoning models take it further by, for example, planning out code logic or performing debugging by reasoning about error messages. A model like o1-coder (from research) or GPT-4 with CoT can iterate: write some code, if a test fails or error occurs, analyze the stack trace, figure out the bug, fix it – effectively doing what a human developer would do in a debug session. This has huge implications for software development productivity. A case study from late 2024 showed GPT-4 (with chain-of-thought enabled) solving competitive programming problems at a very high success rate, often by trying a solution, seeing it didn’t pass, then trying a different approach ￼. That kind of self-directed debugging is a hallmark of reasoning ability.
	•	Education (Tutoring systems): Imagine an AI tutor that not only gives the correct answer but also teaches the student how to get there. Reasoning LLMs can power such tutors. For instance, a student asks a calculus question – the AI can guide them step-by-step, even asking the student intermediate questions. If the student is stuck, the AI can show a worked solution. Because the model can keep track of each step, it can also identify where the student might have a misconception. Projects in the education tech space are actively looking at LLMs that can reason as a way to provide adaptive, step-wise learning support.
	•	Planning and Robotics: In robotics or automated planning (like scheduling, routing problems), reasoning LLMs may serve as high-level planners. For example, say a robot needs to come up with a plan to move through a house and clean certain rooms. A reasoning LLM could outline the plan (“First go to kitchen, because it’s on the way to living room, then…”) which is then executed by the robot’s low-level controllers. While traditionally such planning was done with symbolic AI, LLMs are now showing capability to do it with the right prompting. Google’s Gemini is aimed partly at such planning tasks in multi-modal contexts ￼.
	•	Case study – Finance: A fintech company used a reasoning LLM to generate personalized financial reports. The model would take a user’s financial data (via RAG) and then answer questions like “Why did my expenses spike this month?” with a stepwise breakdown (e.g., “You had a large one-time payment for X, plus increased spending on Y…”). It could also project scenarios: “If I cut dining out by 20%, how much will I save in a year?” The reasoning model works through the math and assumptions explicitly, giving the user not just an answer but the confidence in how that answer was derived. In regulated industries like finance, that transparency is valuable.

Each of these examples showcases a theme: the need for multi-step thinking. Whenever an application demands careful analysis, logical combination of information, or intermediate decision points, a reasoning LLM is a strong choice. They bring the AI’s capability closer to human-like problem solving, where we naturally think in sequences and reflect on our answers.

Key Takeaways from Applications:
	•	Start simple, then scale up complexity. Many teams began with a standard LLM, hit accuracy limits on complex queries, then introduced reasoning prompts or models to overcome those barriers.
	•	User trust and experience: Showing reasoning can increase trust (users feel the AI is not a magic box but a logical tool). However, showing too much can overwhelm; often the best UI is to give the final answer and let the user click to “show reasoning” if they want to see it.
	•	Fine-tuning for domain: Real-world cases often involve fine-tuning a reasoning model on domain-specific reasoning data (e.g., a corpus of legal QA pairs with explanations, or annotated student answers with reasoning). This specialization can yield large improvements. If you have proprietary data, consider fine-tuning an open reasoning model on it to get a custom model.
	•	Continuous learning: Because reasoning LLMs can explain their mistakes, collecting those and feeding them back for fine-tuning or few-shot examples is a powerful loop. Some companies keep logs of where the model’s reasoning failed and periodically update the model (or prompt) to address those failure modes.
