Contract talent in 48 hrs.\\n\\nBalanced\\n• LinkedIn paid slots + design-specific boards (Dribbble, Working Not Working, UX Jobs Board).  \\n• In-house recruiter outreach.\\n\\nLonger funnel / wider reach\\n• Portfolio communities (ADPList, Women In Product Design).  \\n• Speaker meetups / conferences for passive senior talent.\\n\\n────────────────────────\\n6. INTERVIEW LOOP (2-3 HRS TOTAL)\\n────────────────────────\\n1. 30 min initial screen – motivation, domain fit, salary/rate check.  \\n2. 45 min portfolio deep-dive – pick 1 project, probe for problem framing, constraints, metrics.  \\n3. 60 min live design collaboration – whiteboard a flow, include PM + Engineer to test cross-functionality.  \\n4. 15 min stakeholder fit call (exec or founder).  \\n5. Reference checks (ex-manager + ex-peer).  \\n\\nPass criteria rubric (score 1–5 each):  \\n• Problem-solving rigor  \\n• Communication & storytelling  \\n• Craft & systems thinking  \\n• Velocity / autonomy  \\n• Leadership & mentoring\\n\\n────────────────────────\\n7. ONBOARDING LITE (FIRST 4 WEEKS)\\n────────────────────────\\nWeek 1: product walkthrough, data dashboards, research repositories.  \\nWeek 2: run a “listening tour” (shadow support, sales, PMs).  \\nWeek 3: quick-win usability evaluation → deliver top-5 issues.  \\nWeek 4: present 90-day UX roadmap tied to business goals.\\n\\n────────────────────────\\n8. RISK MITIGATION\\n────────────────────────\\n• Put a 2-week opt-out clause in any contract.  \\n• Attach a 90-day guarantee with agencies (free replacement).  \\n• Maintain design hand-off artifacts in shared Figma library for continuity.  \\n• Keep at least 10 % of annual design budget unallocated for sudden extensions or tools.\\n\\n────────────────────────\\n9. NEXT ACTIONS FOR YOU (CHOOSE PATH)\\n────────────────────────\\nIf “Need work NOW” →  \\n1) Lock 3-mo contract budget cap (e.g., $60 k).  \\n2) Push out contractor JD today; aim to shortlist by Day 5.  \\n3) Parallel-track permanent search to avoid reset in 3 months.\\n\\nIf “Can wait 3 months” →  \\n1) Finalize salary band this week.  \\n2) Kick off perm recruiting at T-4 weeks (so offer by T-8 weeks).  \\n3) Use intervening time for discovery sprint or design audit to sharpen role.\\n\\n────────────────────────\\n10.
