    "## Summary and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We've Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **o1 is NOT a chat model** - It's a report generator that excels at complex reasoning\n",
    "2. **Context is king** - Give 10x more context than you think you need\n",
    "3. **Focus on WHAT, not HOW** - Let o1 figure out the approach\n",
    "4. **One-shot is the goal** - Aim to get the right answer in a single request\n",
    "5. **Choose wisely** - Use the right model for the right task\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **DO:**\n",
    "- Write comprehensive briefs\n",
    "- Provide extensive context\n",
    "- Be specific about outputs\n",
    "- Use for complex, multi-step problems\n",
    "- Think \"email\" not \"chat\"\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùå **DON'T:**\n",
    "- Use for simple tasks\n",
    "- Write lazy prompts\n",
    "- Expect real-time responses\n",
    "- Try to have conversations\n",
    "- Tell it HOW to think\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convert a Chat Prompt**: Take a simple prompt you'd use with GPT-4 and expand it into a comprehensive brief for o1\n",
    "2. **Context Building**: Pick a complex problem and build a 1000+ word context document\n",
    "3. **Model Selection**: Analyze 5 different tasks and choose the optimal model for each\n",
    "4. **Cost Analysis**: Calculate the cost difference between using o1-preview vs a combination of GPT-3.5 + o1-mini\n",
    "\n",
